# File Tree in Markiva

Markiva includes a built-in file browser to help you navigate, open, and manage your Markdown documents from a specific folder. The **file tree panel** appears on the right-hand side and provides easy access to your project‚Äôs `.md` files.

## 1. Accessing the File Tree

The **File Tree** is part of the sidebar under **"Project Files"**:

- Located on the right, below the Notes section
- Lists all `.md` files in your current working directory
- Allows you to click and open files in tabs instantly

- You can refresh the list manually with the **refresh** button

- Partial matches supported (e.g., typing `doc` shows `docs.md`)

### üìÑ Right-Click Context Menu

## 3. Working Folder

By default, Markiva uses the current working directory unless a **default folder** is set in settings.

To change the working folder:

1. Open the **Settings** panel
2. Set a custom default folder path
3. Restart Markiva or refresh the file list

---

## 4. Creating New Files

Use the **New File** button (plus icon) in the top left sidebar:

1. Enter a file name (e.g., `my-notes.md`)
2. Markiva automatically adds the `.md` extension if omitted
3. The file is created and opened immediately in a new tab

---

## 5. Managing Files

You can:

- **Save changes** using the Save icon or `Ctrl + S`
- **Rename** using the sidebar button or context menu
- **Delete** files (with confirmation) via right-click

Changes are written directly to disk, so edits are persistent.

---

## 6. Drag-and-Drop Support

You can also drag `.md` files directly into the Markiva window to open them in tabs. This works even if they aren‚Äôt part of the default working directory.

---

## 7. File State Indicators

- Modified files show an asterisk (*) in the tab title
- Unsaved changes prompt you before closing a tab or exiting the app

---

## 8. Tips for Organizing Your Workspace

- Keep all related `.md` files in a project folder
- Use descriptive names like `meeting-notes.md`, `todo.md`, `guide.md`
- Pin key notes in the Notes panel for easy access
